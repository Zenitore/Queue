# Queue

This code is the creation of another storage device. Queue works using node and then creating a line of which you can edit. For example you can remove the first input item but only that item. After it is removed the one behind it becomes the front of the line. You can add to the end of the line but only the end of the line. After adding an element that element becomes the last in line.
